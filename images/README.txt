This folder contains placeholder SVG images used by the demo site.
Place your images here and name them or update the HTML to point to your files.

Default placeholders included:
- car-placeholder.svg
- motorcycle-placeholder.svg

You can add your own motorcycle image (like the one you attached) and name it:
- motorcycle-real.png

If `motorcycle-real.png` exists in this folder the homepage will display it automatically; otherwise the SVG placeholder will be used as a fallback.

If you add large photos, consider optimizing them for the web (resize and compress). Commit binary images normally, but they won't render in text diffs.
